# calculator-for-resistors-and-capacitors
Project made for educational purposes.
Application WITH GUI interface mede using cuctomtkinter module.
The functionality of the application has been divided into three parts.

First part is for tht resistors and make calculete resistance for resistors marked 4 or 5 bands color code. 
Second part is for smd resistorsand make calculete resistance for resistors market in 4 ways:
- 3 numbers code,
- 4 numbers code,
- EIC96 code
- code for resistance below 10 ohms
Third part is for calculates capacity for different types of capacitors.
